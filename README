== What is this? ==

This directory contains projects which are related to MacPorts. But they are
not being shipped with the base code itself, instead you are supposed to check
them out from Subversion and build them yourself. Some of them are also
available as ports in the tree or are used as a base to create multiple ports.

    This is an attempt to write an build server for MacPorts which tests ports
    automatically.

    information:
